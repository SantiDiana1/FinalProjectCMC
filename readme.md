# PROJECT

Final project done by Santiago Diand and @iferco. Having taken the groove transformer from the MTG, our work was to implement the PureData patch and the python code that allow to interpolate rhythm generations in a 2D xy plane.

When the python script starts running, the goal of our implementation is to control which generations should be done by the model depending on the position in a 2D plane. That plane has four different rhytms in the corners and we interpolate them depending on the position. 

Work done in the context of the Computational Music Creativity in the Sound and Music Computing master's degree at UPF (Barcelona).
